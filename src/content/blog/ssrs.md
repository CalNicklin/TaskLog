[Safer Seas & Rivers Service](https://www.sas.org.uk/water-quality/sewage-pollution-alerts/safer-seas-rivers-service/) is an award-winning, free app which is the only national Water Quality service that provides real-time sewage and pollution alerts on UK bathing waters.

### Task

The app existed already, but was coming to the end of its life. Being built on Xammarin - a technology that was being deprecated - the future of the SSRS app was bleak. I worked as part of the ASquared team to completely rebuild the app in React Native / Expo, with a super user-centric new UI/UX design and some killer new features that brought it bang up to date. I worked on this app in an agile team of 5: 

- Myself - Software Engineer
- Alex Reid - Lead Software Engineer
- Nooosh Greenaway - Project Manager
- Sybbie Marquez - Designer
- Nick Kuh - Agency Director

### Achievements

- Achieving 60fps animated map performance on iOS.
- Big improvements of the a11y for this app.
- Empowering the SSRS team by restructuring their user-submitted report db to improve data usability and readabilty.
- 99.9% crash-free sessions.
- Contributing to UX research workshops.
- Weekly liasing with client in playbacks.
- Implementing new API endpoints to improve performance and shareability of key screens in the app.
- Major contributions to a significant app build within my first 3 months as a junior.

### Tech

- React Native
- Expo Managed Workflow (EAS)
- Typescript


### Recognition

`I’ve been Incredibly privileged to have worked with the talented team at ASquared on the update and I can’t wait to see what this partnership brings. ✊` - Annie, SSRS Projects Officer

`Massive shout out to  Cal who have been doing stellar work for SAS! Also for doing further research into map functionality! This has inadvertently led our team imagining/discussing how we can further enhance SAS' user experience!I cannot say enough how much I truly applaud all our devs and how they think! I believe having that strong footing on what's possible paves the way for great ideas from everyone else! Thou art the rock from which we stand! Huge huge thank you from Design!!`

`To add even more to this, when I tested the app last week it was really impressive to see the lack of bugs or issues, and anything I could find (and I was REALLY looking to find things) was already fixed or known about and being fixed!Really amazing work guys! @Alex Reid @Cal`
