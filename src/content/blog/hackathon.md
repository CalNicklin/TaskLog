### Task

Try new technologies, build a better dev team. At work trying out low code technologies, but skunkily we were finding out where we can improve our efficiencies - and how. I started using LinearB to quantify the status quo, and we've started implementing trunk based dev amongst other time saving things.
Got really into DevEx this week and have been reading avidly!

### Achievements

- Measure and baseline our current processes. 
- Learn and implement new engineering management technologies and tools (LinearB).
- Identify where we can add value to clients and improve DevEx.
- Present findings to the team.

### Recognition
