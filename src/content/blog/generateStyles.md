### Task

Last week I identified an area where we spent way too much time copying info from one place to another - aka data entry. I found that the creation of React Native stylesheets: wastes hours or days of time at the start of a project, is error-prone, and requires no useful thinking. So I am working on iterations of an automation tool for this.

### Achievements

- Identified this is an area where gains can be made. 
- Write shell script to handle executions.
- Refactor Figma exports into RN stylesheet in a single step.
- Cross-department collaboration with Design.

### Recognition
