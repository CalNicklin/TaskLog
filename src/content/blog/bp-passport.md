[BP Passport](https://www.simple.org/bp-passport/) is an app used in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Ethiopia to record patient blood-pressure, blood-sugar and medication schedule. It's part of long-term study into hypertension and is free to use.

### Task

Migrating an existing React Native app to Expo and an a new region-specific API end-point. My first project as a professional Software Engineer.

### Achievements

- Bug fixing for tricky bugs caused by incorrect type definitions deep in translation files.
- Getting up to speed with Expo and RN packages, solving dependancy errors.
- Learning how-to and publishing an app to App Store and Google Play store.

### Recognition

`I wanted to reiterate great work @Alex Reid and @Cal did on the BP Passport project. It was a great learning opportunity and the team just took it and run with it. This is a shoutout for being bold, smart and caring.`
