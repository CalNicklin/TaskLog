### Trigger

Late last year James and I built a successful proof of concept that showed AI's viabililty for creating in-context, story driven learning courses.
Now, we're taking that into production and this requires server side AI course generation. 

### Task

Architect + build the process that handles a queue of long running server tasks with excellent observability.
